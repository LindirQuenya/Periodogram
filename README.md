# Periodogram
This is the python code for a periodogram (converted from C++).
There are three periodogram algorithms availiable: Box Least Squares, Lomb-Scargle, and Plavchan.
There are also five period-stepping types: standard, exponential, fixed period, fixed frequency, and plavchan.
Multiprocessing not yet finished, but hopefully coming soon.
